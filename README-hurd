Steps to generate the necessary binaries to start GNU Hurd through the GNU Guix package manager.

1) In Debian GNU/Hurd prepare the environment for GNU Guix.

 1.1) Install all dependencies required for GNU Guile 2.2,
      you can install those packages from tarballs.
      
2) Add RAW file to QEMU with the label 'my-root', format the partition (ext2)
   and mount the new partition under /guix.
   
3) Build the hello package to test.

4) In Debian GNU/Hurd we don't have '/proc/partitions', as workaround copy the partition file
   to your home and change the PATH in (build file-systems).
   
5) Generate all the binaries required to boot GNU Hurd.
   "./pre-inst-env guix system init ~/guix/doc/os-config-hurd.scm /guix 
    --fallback --no-substitutes"
